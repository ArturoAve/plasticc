# Kyle Boone's code for the 2018 Kaggle PLAsTiCC challenge.

This repository contains the code for the winning solution to the [2018 Kaggle
PLAsTiCC challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018). For details on my
approach, see the [overview of the
solution](https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018/discussion/75033).

This code is made up of a sequence of scripts that produce the final output one
step at a time. The main package is the `plasticc.py` file which contains the
Dataset class which is used to read the lightcurve and meta data, compute and
reload features and produce the final predictions.

## Installation

The analysis is structured with a set of folders.
